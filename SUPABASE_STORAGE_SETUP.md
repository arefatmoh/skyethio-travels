# Supabase Storage Setup Guide

## üöÄ **Complete File Upload & Download Implementation**

Your admin dashboard now has **real file upload and download functionality**! Here's how to set it up:

## üîß **Step 1: Set Up Supabase Storage**

### **1.1 Create Storage Bucket**
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Storage** ‚Üí **Buckets**
3. Click **"New Bucket"**
4. Create a bucket named `documents`
5. Set it as **Public** (for now, for easy access)

### **1.2 Configure Storage Policies**
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Allow public access to documents bucket
CREATE POLICY "Public Access" ON storage.objects FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'documents');

-- Allow authenticated users to upload files
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload files" ON storage.objects 
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'documents' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Allow authenticated users to update their files
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own files" ON storage.objects 
FOR UPDATE USING (bucket_id = 'documents' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Allow authenticated users to delete their files
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own files" ON storage.objects 
FOR DELETE USING (bucket_id = 'documents' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

## üóÑÔ∏è **Step 2: Update Database Schema**

Run this SQL to add file storage fields:

```sql
-- Add file storage fields to visa_applications
ALTER TABLE visa_applications ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS passport_file_url TEXT;
ALTER TABLE visa_applications ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS bank_statement_url TEXT;

-- Add file storage fields to bookings
ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS passport_file_url TEXT;
```

## üìÅ **Step 3: Test File Upload**

5. Submit the form
